# Lab 8 - Starter

1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

I would run the automated tests within a github action after it is pushed. Using github actions would promote a CI pipeline. Furthermore, everyone working on the project will be able to see the error and individually work on the fix. It also makes the progression of the project more transparent.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

No I would not because this type of test aligns with a unit test.
